 * Always put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ), and after commas.

 * Always use 1 tab space for indentation of code blocks.
 * Always end a simple statement with a semicolon.

 * Put the opening bracket at the end of the first line.
 * Use one space before the opening bracket.

 * Put the closing bracket on a new line, without leading spaces.
 * Use lower case file names without any special characters or spaces.

 * Function should do one thing. They should do it well.
